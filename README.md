A quantile transform will map a variables probability distribution to another probability distrbution , Recall that a quantile function, aslo called a percent-point function(PPF), is the inverse of the cumulative
probability of a value at or below a givenvalue, The PPF is the inverse of this function and returns the value at or below a given probability, The quantile function ranks or smooth out the relationship between 
observations and can be mapped onto other distributions
